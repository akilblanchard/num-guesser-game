# Nnumber Guessing Game
---
This a number guessing game where the computer will pick a number in a given range and the player will attempt to guess that number

---

## Motivation behind this project
Honestly, this project was done just because I wanted to try doing it.

---

## What I Utilized
~ Implemented an error-handling setup making use of a try-except block. Capturing ValueError exceptions to handle cases where the user input cannot be converted to int, providing an explanatory error messages.

~ Applied Conditional logic using if, else and break staments to control the flow of the game.

~ Used an infinite while True loop to maintain the game's main loop until the required condition was attained. Utilized a break statement to exit the loop when the computer's number os guessed.
